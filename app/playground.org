Hi Lapo and Max,

I'm grateful for our recent discussion, which has further piqued my excitement about contributing to this project. With my background and career goals aligned, I find this opportunity intriguing. I've realized the importance of establishing client trust and am prepared to dedicate three to four days a week in Geneva during the blueprinting phase and transition to a hybrid mode during implementation. To move forward with PD and attend the upcoming meeting, please provide me with the email invite (CC) for confirmation.

I apologize, but it seems there has been a misunderstanding.

Dear Thierry and Loïc,

I hope this message finds you both well.

I wanted to inquire if it would be acceptable for us to discontinue hosting the NOP application on our cloud, allowing you the opportunity to operate it during your acquisition of a commercial license.

Would that be all right with you? Additionally, have you succeeded in obtaining a commercial solver license?

Best regards,

Louis

Dear Thierry and Loïc,

I hope you are both doing well.

I wanted to inquire whether you still require the NOP application to be hosted on our cloud, or if we may proceed to discontinue it. Have you managed to secure a commercial solver license, or are there still additional runs needed?

Thank you,

Louis

Dear Lapo and Max,

I hope this email finds you both in good health.

I have secured soft-locking until the 22nd of January with Product Development and arranged staffing from that date onwards.

Lapo, I will arrange the travel to Geneva for this Thursday and will prepare a document to facilitate our discussions. I propose we cover the following agenda items:
- Team introductions
- Recap of the schedule, activities, and governance for the initial four weeks.

Please let me know if there's anything else you'd like to discuss.

Lapo mentioned that the pages you have created for Inland could serve as a good reference for us. Would you be amenable to sharing those with me?

Thank you very much for your help.

Hi,

Thank you, Vale and Vincent.
This sounds like a fantastic opportunity.

Please let me know how I can best contribute.

Hi Laszlo,

Thank you very much for the update; it was super clear. I agree that starting with the basics makes perfect sense. How did the steering committee meeting go?

Regarding DEOP, please let me know if you believe it would be practical to use it to size the full value at stake after mapping out the process and when you have a clear understanding of the current schedule. I believe it would be beneficial, as DEOP can be set up fairly quickly once we have the process outlined. We just need to list the steps and equipment in Excel. Additionally, we are seeking use-cases to beta-test our tool in various client settings.

I am at your disposal should you wish to give it a try after the break.

Best,

Louis

Dear Kapil and Team,

As we discussed, our current process involves performing a database dump, which is not particularly convenient for those who may need to extract information at a later stage.

It would be highly beneficial if we could develop a script that extracts data for all scenarios from the database and organizes it into a dedicated folder. The data to be extracted should include:
- Input and output files
- Input parameters
- Charts in JSON format

I look forward to your thoughts on this.

Best regards,

Louis

Dear Team,

I trust you are all doing well.

I've recently spoken with Valerio, who emphasized the importance of integrating PlanAI tools such as VMX, DPO, and IMPro within APS as a key strategic focus for 2024. With this in mind, I am putting together a team—including you—to collaborate on developing the necessary capabilities and tooling to integrate our suite of planning solutions with APS. Our efforts will build upon the progress made with o9 and VMX and will extend to include other APS and PlanAI tools.

Would you be interested in participating in this initiative? Additionally, who else should we consider involving to ensure our success?

I plan to schedule a series of calls next year to maintain momentum on this project.

Best regards,

Louis

Global Logistics, pivotal to Bunge’s supply chain operations, enhances value by optimizing maritime transport and mitigating execution risks. The department is embracing digital tools and analytics, with three key initiatives (Polo Revamp, Stock Management, and Contract Management) progressing towards MVPs from October 2023 to April 2024. To hone its future strategy, Bunge aims to rapidly develop further projects including a Control Tower for comprehensive supply chain monitoring, and Mathematical Optimization for automated execution plans. The immediate goals for the coming months are to ensure the successful rollout of ongoing projects and to refine plans for these new initiatives.

Global Logistics is key to Bunge’s supply chain, managing ocean transportation and mitigating risks to optimize asset utilization and enhance value creation. The division is enhancing its processes through digitalization and analytics, working on three projects – Polo Revamp, Stock Management, and Contract Management – with minimum viable products expected between October 2023 and April 2024.

To advance its vision and drive more value with agility, Bunge will assess and plan further initiatives like the Control Tower, a comprehensive alert system integrated with the supply chain to monitor execution risks and contract compliance, potentially including competitor vessel tracking. Additionally, mathematical optimization will be explored for automated execution planning, necessitating a thorough blueprint phase for scope definition.

Over the next months, the priority is to deliver current projects and outline the future roadmap for the Optimization and Control Tower initiatives.

Dear Team,

Attached is the first draft of the document for Thursday, which Marion and I have been working on.

For our PS session later today, we propose the following agenda:
- Confirm logistics for Thursday (arrival times, remote participation details, and the on-site contact's phone number)
- Review content for Thursday (please refer to the attached document)
- Discuss the staffing plan and WIP requirements (do we have a budget for an additional Asc or BA?)
- Clarify the scope of Ocean Flows based on Edson's most recent document.

Dear Marcio,

Thank you for the insightful meeting we had earlier. 
It was extremely helpful to walk through the decision log file with you and gain an understanding of the daily decisions your team makes during "re-planning."

Following our discussion, I have scheduled the following:
(i) Two touchpoints on Tuesday, 16/01, and Thursday, 18/01, to review the work plan and ensure all logistics are set for the 22/01 kick-off.
(ii) Weekly touchpoints with you every Thursday at 2 pm.
(iii) The kick-off meeting with your team on Monday, 22/01, at 10:30 am.

Could I ask you to:
- Forward the kick-off invitation to your team?
- Schedule a 2-hour final review on Thursday, 15/02, with Christos?
- Send us the decision log Excel files that we discussed during our meeting. We would like to review them to be fully prepared for the 22/01 start date.

I will provide you with the names of the team members who will be joining us on the 22/01 as soon as our list is finalized, so you can arrange badges and chairs for them.

We will update the work plan based on our discussion today and will review it together on Tuesday, 16/01.

Wishing you a joyous holiday season.

Best regards,

Louis

Hi Elizabeta,

Thank you very much for your assistance. 

Following our discussion with leadership and the client yesterday, we've determined that we're looking for candidates with:
- Strong analytical capabilities, such as proficiency with numbers
- Excellent interpersonal skills to foster robust client relationships
- Being local would be highly advantageous

Currently, I notice there's just one profile in the Geneva office (excluding XXX, as he is already a JEM and likely more suited for a BA/Associate role). 
Could you provide additional profiles that match the criteria mentioned above?

Thank you once again for your help.

Best regards,

Louis

Dear Max and Marion,

I am on the hunt for the ideal consultant to come on board with our team by 22/01. I have compiled a list of potential candidates and shared their profiles via the following Box link: [LINK]. Could you please take an initial look and mark any prospects that stand out?

I have also been in touch with PD to emphasize the need for candidates with robust analytical skills and exceptional interpersonal abilities. I will continue to update the list with new profiles as they come in.

Best regards,
